Relish traditional home made food.

A platform to buy and sell home made food items.

With fast growing cities it is difficult to find shops which would sell our traditional 
home made food items.

I really miss eating  food items like tamarind lolipop, sabudana vada, chikkies, etc

There are many who still have quench for traditional food items.

This project aims to bridge a gap between people who love preparing traditional dishes and food items with people who love to eat those food items.
